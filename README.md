# Healthcare-Patient-Waiting-List-Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard that analyzes healthcare data to track and visualize patient waiting lists. It uses Power Query to clean and consolidate data from multiple files, and features an interactive dashboard to monitor historical trends and key performance indicators by specialty and age.


# Project Description
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of patient waiting list data. Built for healthcare stakeholders, the dashboard enables users to monitor real-time metrics, identify historical trends, and gain actionable insights into patient wait times and demographics.

# Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to transform raw, disconnected healthcare data from multiple sources into a single, cohesive, and visually compelling dashboard. This tool empowers administrators to make informed decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care by effectively managing waiting lists.

# Key Features
**Dynamic and Interactive Dashboard**: A two-page report that allows for high-level summaries and granular, detailed analysis.

**Data Consolidation**: The project uses Power Query to connect to and combine data from multiple Excel files, ensuring a single source of truth.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs**): Tracks critical metrics such as total waiting list count, average waiting times, and performance against targets.

**Trend Analysis**: Visualizes historical data with line charts, enabling users to spot monthly and yearly trends in both inpatient and outpatient categories.

**Demographic Breakdown**: Provides insights into patient demographics with analysis by specialty, age profile, and case type.
**
User-Friendly Interface**: Includes slicers for easy filtering, navigation buttons between report pages, and dynamic titles for a seamless user experience.

# Technologies
**Power BI Desktop**: Used for the entire development lifecycle, from data modeling and transformation to dashboard design.

**Power Query:** A powerful tool within Power BI used for data cleaning, transformation, and combining data sources.

**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Implemented to create custom measures and calculated columns for dynamic metrics and analysis.

# Getting Started
